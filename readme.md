## Building:

### Requirements:
 - [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
 -  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

To build Drinol, just make a folder somewhere where you would like to build it, then execute this command inside of it:

```console
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/matty45/Drinol.git
```
All you have to do now is open Drinol.sln in the new folder and build it inside of Visual Studio.
